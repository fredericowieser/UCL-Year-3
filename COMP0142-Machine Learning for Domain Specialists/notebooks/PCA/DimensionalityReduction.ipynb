    "# Notebook 5: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore Dimensionality Reduction and to a lesser extent Clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the MNIST data set, a standard testbed for simple machine learning tasks, which is described in the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database. It comprises a training set of 60,000 handwritten images, and a test set of 10,000. Each data point consists of a 24x24 pixel image, which represents one of 10 handwritten numbers. It is often used for classification purposes, however we will apply different dimensionality and clustering methods to the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially we will be applying dimensionality reduction for visualisation purposes, and we will begin by applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA): both using Scikit-Learn and a version coded by hand. Following this we will look at using Linear Discriminant Analysis as well as $t$-SNE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will examine different uses of dimensionality reduction, such as: Increasing the training speed of a logistic classifier; improving predictive performance on noisy images; and reconstructing de-noised images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we will introduce clustering to aid classification accuracy when we have only a few labelled training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction and Clustering are both reasonably large areas within Machine Learning and we have merely scratched the surface of these fields of study. The goal of the laboratory is to come away with an understanding of some application areas and be able to implement the simpler ones yourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the code in this notebook originally comes from code accompanying 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow', by A. Geron."
